0,TAPI SEKARANG SUDAH MELEWATI JALAN TOL,BUT NOW IT HAS PASSED THE TOLL ROAD
1,"macam2 insiden di toll jadi tetap juga ada bang kan tidak menjadi NOL untuk di tol misal sering menabrak kendaraan didepannya, atau slip terguling, tabrak marka jalan, over speeding","There are also various incidents on the toll road, so it's not a ZERO for the toll road, for example, often hitting the vehicle in front of it, or rolling slips, hitting road markings, over speeding."
2,Kita sudah di ajarkan tentang Smith sistem defensive driving dll. Mugkin dulu ketika masih bernama Caltex accident tak begitu diperhatikan. Biaya produksi masih tertutupi oleh hasil SDA yg melimpah.Dulu setelah swab test hasil Cruise oil masih 90% dg design reda pump HN 13500/... Stg/250HP dg pump set rendah Sekarang hanya memakai D425N / stg / HP dg PS nya dalam karna water cut sudah 99.9%.Makanya safety menjadi prioritas unggulan dlm program Chevron atau perusahaan migas.,We have been taught about Smith defensive driving system etc. Maybe in the past when it was still called Caltex accidents were not so concerned. Production costs are still covered by the abundant natural resources.In the past after the swab test the Cruise oil results were still 90% with the design reda pump HN 13500 /... Stg/250HP with low pump set Now only use D425N / stg / HP with deep PS because the water cut is 99.9%.That's why safety is a top priority in Chevron's program or oil and gas companies.
3,"Reda size yg mo di install berdasarkan hasil swab sy setuju boss Tapi kok korelasi nya ke ""SAFETY FIRST""sepertinya nggak nyambung tuh maaf apa argu sy ini salah salam sehat",Reda size that mo installed based on the results of the swab I agree boss But how come the correlation to “SAFETY FIRST” does not seem to be connected tuh sorry what my argument is wrong healthy greetings
4,iya setuju pak Eldy...belum nampak korelasi antara tingkat produksi dan angka kecelakaan lalin..,Yes I agree Mr Eldy...there is no correlation between the level of production and the number of traffic accidents …
5,"Penggunaan mobil operasional pun dikurang, TDK ada lagi supv atau supt departemen yg mendapat fasilitas mobil 24jam kecuali oncall","The use of operational cars has also been reduced, no more supv or supt departments get 24 hour car facilities except oncall."

18,"Sy rasa saat itu belum di galakkan Defensive Driving Habits. Disamping itu mungkin karena pd tahun² itu jalanan masih sepi, Rambu² terbatas, jadi pengemudi abai. Se ingat saya DDC baru dimulai tahun² 70an. Saya ikut DDC pertama kali sesaat sebelum selesai Automotive Mechanical Training July 1972 setelah lulus Driver Training dan dapat SIM (Rebewes). Di DDC tsb lah kita diajar pake seat belt, sehingga kita² dari awal nyetir di Caltex sdh biasa dgn seat belt yg jd bully an pegawai² lama yg cuek dgn itu. Mereka bilang: wah amerika hitam,,,, karena yg selalu pake seat belt saat itu ya bule².","I guess at that time Defensive Driving Habits was not encouraged. Besides, maybe because in those years the roads were still quiet, signs were limited, so drivers were ignorant. As far as I remember, DDC only started in the 70s. I joined DDC for the first time just before finishing Automotive Mechanical Training in July 1972 after passing Driver Training and getting my driver's license (Rebewes). It was in DDC that we were taught to use seat belts, so that we were used to driving at Caltex from the beginning with seat belts, which became a bully for old employees who were ignorant of it"

When speaking at WS, his voice was firm, loud, very disciplined, and respected.I was again grateful to be “trained” by Mr. Muchtar even though his time was relatively short.I took the time to go to the funeral home where the late Mr. Muchtar was laid to rest before being buried in Al Fatehah for the late Mr. Muchtar."
